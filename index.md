## About Me

I'm a multi-disciplinary software developer with a background in business analysis, project coordination, software training and product ownership. I'm not yet specialized in a particular language or framework but have dabbled in Java (Eclipse), HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PHP (Atom), and SQL (Postgres / Access / MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle).

I'm reliable, a good communicator, and I care a great deal about producing good quality work.

Growth is very important to me - I ask a lot of questions and listen closely to the answers, and I believe there is always room to improve. If the team needs a skill, I'm happy to learn and, when appropriate, happy to teach.

## Goals

I'm **currently seeking a permanent full-time position starting September 2022**. I'd prefer to work majority remotely on a development team, and have several years experience working successfully (as a BA) with remote software development teams in Canada and abroad.

## Contact Info

Want to get in touch? I can be reached on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samanthaljackson/)** any time.
