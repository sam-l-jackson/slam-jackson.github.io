## About Me

I'm a multi-disciplinary software developer with a background in business analysis, project coordination, software training and product ownership. I'm not yet specialized in a particular language or framework but have dabbled in Java (Eclipse), HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PHP (Atom), and SQL (Postgres / Access / MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle).

I'm reliable, a good communicator, and I care a great deal about producing good quality work.

Growth is very important to me - I ask a lot of questions and listen closely to the answers, and I believe there is always room to improve. If the team needs a skill, I'm happy to learn and, when appropriate, happy to teach.

## Goals

I'm **currently seeking a permanent full-time position starting September 2022**. I'd prefer to work majority remotely on a development team, and have several years experience working successfully (as a BA) with remote software development teams in Canada and abroad.

## Contact Info

Want to get in touch? I can be reached on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samanthaljackson/)** any time.

## Projects

### My Bus Tracker - Android App

#### Project Description

This app has been decoupled from an academic group project in which each participant was responsible for one standalone app of four presented as a bundle. This decoupled app comprises my own work.
The app allows the user to save their commonly used bus routes and call up current details about the next bus using the local (OC Transpo) API.
